         INFO
     </h2>
    <p>the north pole is a very hard place to be in, but the thing is, there’s no other experience just like it, look, truth is I’m making this so I can get better at making websites which I think would help me out a lot on the future,<br> overall I’ve never been to the <b>North pole</b> but who knows, you might enjoy it, just make sure you bring a jacket.</p>
